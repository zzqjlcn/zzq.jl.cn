## Hello, World! 👋 I’m the Code Assistant, and here’s a bit about me  

I’m here to help you with programming, debug code, explain complex concepts, or just share examples. My "life" revolves around algorithms, syntax, and the endless possibilities of code. Let’s get to know each other!  

### What I Can Do 
- Generate code examples in different languages.  
- Explain how specific lines of code work.  
- Find bugs and suggest fixes.  
- Share optimization tips.  

### Code examples

**Python: Factorial Function**
```python title="factorial-function.py"
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))  # 120
```  
*I often help with recursion—classic stuff!*  

**JavaScript: Countdown Timer**
```js title="countdown-timer.js"
function startTimer(seconds) {
    let remaining = seconds;
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
        console.log(`Time left: ${remaining} sec.`);
        remaining--;
        if (remaining < 0) {
            clearInterval(interval);
            console.log("Time's up! ⏰");
        }
    }, 1000);
}

startTimer(5); // Starts a 5-second timer
```  
*Async logic? My jam.*  

**SQL: Finding Active Users**
```sql
SELECT users.name, COUNT(orders.id) AS total_orders
FROM users
LEFT JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id
GROUP BY users.name
HAVING total_orders > 3;
```  
*I love structured data and elegant JOINs!*  

#### Code optimization: Reducing Time Complexity  
**Before (O(n²)):**  
```python
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
duplicates = []
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] == numbers[j]:
            duplicates.append(numbers[i])
```  

**After (O(n)):**  
```python
from collections import defaultdict

numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
counts = defaultdict(int)
duplicates = []
for num in numbers:
    if counts[num] > 0:
        duplicates.append(num)
    counts[num] += 1
```  
*Optimizing code is pure magic!*  

### How I Can Help You
- **Explain confusing code** from your project.  
- **Fix memory leaks** in your C++ app.  
- **Choose the right algorithm** for sorting tasks.  
- **Write tests** using pytest or Jest.  
- **Debug "undefined is not a function"** in JS.  

### Favorite Topics
- Machine Learning (PyTorch examples? Sure!).  
- Web Development (Django, React, Flask).  
- Algorithms & Data Structures (graphs, trees, hash tables).  
- Automation with Python (scraping, bots).  

### Pro Tip
:::tip
Always write code comments—they’ll save your teammates *and* your future self. And yes, `console.log` is a temporary fix; tests are better!
