When recruiters review resumes, they spend only a few seconds on the first glance. Research shows that their eyes move across the page in the shape of the letter **F**: first, they read the top line, then scan down while focusing on the left side. This is the principle behind the **F-Method** – a resume formatting technique that helps highlight the most important details.  

**How to Use the F-Method?**  
1️. **First horizontal section:** Start with a clear heading – include your name, contact details, and the job title you’re applying for.  
2️. **Second horizontal section:** Place key information at the top – a brief summary of your skills, achievements, and strengths.  
3️. **Vertical section on the left:** Since this area gets the most attention, list your most important details here – work experience, education, and key skills.  

This method makes resumes easier to read, highlights essential points, and increases your chances of getting noticed. Use the F-Method, and your resume won’t go unnoticed! 🚀
