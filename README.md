## Configure

- Edit the config file `src/site.config.ts` for basic site meta data
- Update file `astro.config.ts`
  - **Important**: the site property with your own domain.
  - [astro-webmanifest options](https://github.com/alextim/astro-lib/blob/main/packages/astro-webmanifest/README.md)
- Replace & update files within the `/public` folder:
  - icon.svg - used as the source to create favicons & manifest icons
  - social-card.png - used as the default og:image
- Modify file `src/styles/global.css` with your own light and dark styles.
  - You can also modify the theme(s) for markdown code blocks generated by [Rehype Pretty Code](https://rehype-pretty.pages.dev/). Astro Citrus has both a dark (rose-pine) and light (rose-pine-dawn) theme, which can be found in `src/site.config.ts`. You can find more theme(s) and options [here](https://shiki.matsu.io/).
- Edit social links in `src/components/SocialList.astro` to add/replace your media profile. Icons can be found @ [icones.js.org](https://icones.js.org/), per [Astro Icon's instructions](https://www.astroicon.dev/guides/customization/#find-an-icon-set).
- Create/edit posts & notes for your blog within `src/content/post/` & `src/content/note/` with .md/mdx file(s). See [below](#adding-posts-and-notes) for more details.
  - Read [this post](http://astrocitrus.artemkutsan.pp.ua/posts/webmentions/) for adding webmentions to your site.
- OG Image:
  - If you would like to change the style of the generated image the Satori library creates, open up `src/pages/og-image/[slug].png.ts` to the markup function where you can edit the html/tailwind-classes as necessary. You can use this [playground](https://og-playground.vercel.app/) to aid your design.
  - You can also create your own og images and skip satori generating it for you by adding an ogImage property in the frontmatter with a link to the asset, an example can be found in `src/content/post/social-image.md`. More info on frontmatter can be found [here](#frontmatter)
- Optional:
  - Fonts: This theme sets the body element to the font family `font-mono`, located in the global css file `src/styles/global.css`. You can change fonts by removing the variant `font-mono`, after which TailwindCSS will default to the `font-sans` [font family stack](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-family).

## Updating

If you've forked the template, you can [sync the fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) with your own project, remembering to **not** click Discard Changes as you will lose your own.

If you have a template repository, you can add this template as a remote, as discussed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56577184/github-pull-changes-from-a-template-repository).

## Adding posts and notes

This theme utilises [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to organise local Markdown and MDX files, as well as type-checking frontmatter with a schema -> `src/content/config.ts`.

Adding a post/note is as simple as adding your .md(x) files to the `src/content/post` and/or `src/content/note` folder, the filename of which will be used as the slug/url. The posts included with this template are there as an example of how to structure your frontmatter. Additionally, the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/) has a detailed section on markdown pages.

### Post Frontmatter

| Property (\* required) | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **title \***          | Self-explanatory. Used as the text link to the post, the h1 on the post's page, and the page's title property. Has a max length of 60 chars, set in `src/content/config.ts`. |
| **description \***    | Similar to above, used as the SEO description property. Has a min length of 50 and a max length of 160 chars, set in the post schema. |
| **publishDate \***    | Again, pretty simple. To change the date format/locale, currently **en-GB**, update the date option in `src/site.config.ts`. Note you can also pass additional options to the `<FormattedDate>` component if required. |
| **updatedDate**       | This is an optional date representing when a post has been updated, in the same format as the `publishDate`. |
| **seriesId**          | An optional property that groups posts into a series. Posts with the same `seriesId` are considered part of the same series and can be displayed together in order. This allows for better organization of related content. |
| **orderInSeries**     | A numeric value defining the position of a post within a series. Lower values indicate earlier posts in the series, while higher values appear later. Used for sorting and navigation between posts within the same series. |
| **tags**             | Tags are optional with any created post. Any new tag(s) will be shown in `yourdomain.com/posts` & `yourdomain.com/tags`, and generate the page(s) `yourdomain.com/tags/[yourTag]`. |
| **coverImage**       | This is an optional object that will add a cover image to the top of a post. Include both `src`: "_path-to-image_" and `alt`: "_image alt_". You can view an example in `src/content/post/cover-image.md`. |
| **ogImage**          | This is an optional property. An OG Image will be generated automatically for every post where this property **isn't** provided. If you would like to create your own for a specific post, include this property and a link to your image, the theme will then skip automatically generating one. |
| **draft**            | This is an optional property as it is set to `false` by default in the schema. By setting it to `true`, the post will be filtered out of the production build in a number of places, including `getAllPosts()` calls, OG images, RSS feeds, and generated page[s]. You can view an example in `src/content/post/draft-post.md`. |


### Note Frontmatter

| Property (\* required) | Description                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| title \*               | string, max length 60 chars.                       |
| description            | to be used for the head meta description property. |
| publishDate \*         | ISO 8601 format with offsets allowed.              |

### Frontmatter snippet

Astro Citrus includes a helpful VSCode snippet which creates a frontmatter 'stub' for posts and note's, found here -> `.vscode/post.code-snippets`. Start typing the word `frontmatter` on your newly created .md(x) file to trigger it. Visual Studio Code snippets appear in IntelliSense via (⌃Space) on mac, (Ctrl+Space) on windows.

## Pagefind search

This integration brings a static search feature for searching blog posts and notes. In its current form, pagefind only works once the site has been built. This theme adds a postbuild script that should be run after Astro has built the site. You can preview locally by running both build && postbuild.

Search results only includes pages from posts and notes. If you would like to include other/all your pages, remove/re-locate the attribute `data-pagefind-body` to the article tag found in `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro` and `src/components/note/Note.astro`.

It also allows you to filter posts by tags added in the frontmatter of blog posts. If you would rather remove this, remove the data attribute `data-pagefind-filter="tag"` from the link in `src/components/blog/Masthead.astro`.

If you would rather not include this integration, simply remove the component `src/components/Search.astro`, and uninstall both `@pagefind/default-ui` & `pagefind` from package.json. You will also need to remove the postbuild script from here as well.

You can reduce the initial css payload of your css, as demonstrated [here](https://github.com/artemkutsan/astro-citrus/pull/145#issue-1943779868), by lazy loading the web components styles.

## Analytics

You may want to track the number of visitors you receive to your blog/website in order to understand trends and popular posts/pages you've created. There are a number of providers out there one could use, including web hosts such as [vercel](https://vercel.com/analytics), [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/), and [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/).

This theme/template doesn't include a specific solution due to there being a number of use cases and/or options which some people may or may not use.

You may be asked to included a snippet inside the **HEAD** tag of your website when setting it up, which can be found in `src/layouts/Base.astro`. Alternatively, you can add the snippet in `src/components/BaseHead.astro`.

## Deploy

[Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) has a great section and breakdown of how to deploy your own Astro site on various platforms and their idiosyncrasies.

By default the site will be built (see [Commands](#commands) section above) to a `/dist` directory.
